### Pattern
1. Quantitative and CS Fundamentals
1. Coding Question x3
1. Essay writing

### Discussion 
The Quant questions consisted of Aptitude, Reasoning and Mathematics (Probability, Permutations and Combinations and bit of Geometry).

CS Fundamentals were mainly from OS, DBMS and Networking.Along with that, it also had debugging questions which were simple.

The coding round was moderately easy and had 3 questions in total.
- 1 question based on Array.
- 1 question from Dynamic Programming 
- 1 question from Graph (BFS/DFS) with game theory.

### Comments
1. For the coding round, it is likely that there will be 1 question from DP and 1 from Graph(BFS/DFS).
1. Our DP problem was 0/1 Knapsack variation, I donâ€™t exactly remember whether it was from Bounded knapsack/Unbounded Knapsack
1. Essay topic is for about 200 words 
    * "What will you do if there a test(in college) on the day of the interview?"
1. Questions are same for everyone
